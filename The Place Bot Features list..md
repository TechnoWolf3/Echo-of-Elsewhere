The Place Bot Features list.



**:money\_with\_wings: | Economy**

The Place runs on a shared, server-wide economy, quietly connecting most money-based activities through a central bank.



\- Money lost through casino games, fines, or questionable work doesn’t vanish, it flows back into the server.

\- Big wins pull directly from that same pool, meaning the server pays out just as it takes in.

&nbsp; - Because of this, balance matters. The economy needs to be fed as much as it’s spent, or larger payouts may not always be possible.



Everything circulates... Balanced, as all things should be.





**:money\_bag: | Casino**

All casino features can be accessed using /games.

Below is a breakdown of what’s currently available at the tables.

\### 🎟️ Table Fees

To keep the casino balanced and sustainable, table fees scale with your recent winnings.

\- Fees \*\*do not\*\* affect your odds of winning or losing, think of them as a small tax to keep the lights on.

\- Fees are calculated on a rolling 24-hour window:

&nbsp; - More bets and bigger wins = higher fees.

&nbsp; - Losses reduce your calculated winnings, meaning big losses = lower fees.



\### 🃏Blackjack

Sit at the table, trust your gut, and hope the next card doesn’t ruin your night with the classic card game \*\*Blackjack (21)\*\*. 

\- Features all standard moves including Hit, Stand, Split, and Double Down.

\-  Quick rounds, real stakes, and plenty of chances to test your luck.



\### 🎡Roulette

One spin, one outcome, and absolutely no mercy from the wheel.

\- Place bets across Odds \& Evens, Red \& Black, Greens, and more.

\- Simple choices, big swings, and the thrill of watching it all play out.
